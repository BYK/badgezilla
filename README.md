# Badgezilla

Badgezilla is a project for [Mozilla Developer Network Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs). It provides badges/achievements to contributors of MDN Docs by scraping their public activity feeds.
It aims to encourage contribution by using the method of "[gamification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification)" just like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) does.
